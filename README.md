# settler-js

SettlerJS is an open-source version of the Catan board game written in Typescript.

## Roadmap

Current roadmap:

1. Write an initial version with all the board game rules that can be interacted via CLI

2. Write a simple front-end to interact visually with the domain code

3. Add an API layer to interact via HTTP and websockets

4. Add persistence layer to store game data

5. Add a more complex front-end that interacts with the API

6. Host playable version
